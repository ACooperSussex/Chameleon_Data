# Chameleon_Data

Power data for the Chameleon at various wavelengths and a stability analysis over 1 and 30 minute periods.
Power of the pump beam at 800nm is ~4.1W.

csv file name format:
<Duration of Test>_<wavelength>_<mode of OPO>

Modes of OPO:
bypass -- pump beam passes straight through the OPO. Wavelength tuned by chameleon alone.
opo -- OPO used to tune the wavelength. Pump beam at 800nm going into the OPO.
